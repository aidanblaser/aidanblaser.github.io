During his summer internship at the Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory, I served as a mentor to Raphael Benamran (currently a Ph.D. student at MIT). Together, we co-developed [Castawave](https://github.com/aidanblaser/Castawave), a boundary element solver for free surface potential flows specifically adapted to handling nonlinear surface gravity waves. Written in the Julia programming language and inspired by [Dold (1992)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002199919290327U), this numerical solver tracks the positions of Lagrangian fluid particles at the free surface, and is able to simulate breaking waves up until the jet reconnection.
