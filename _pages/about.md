Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography studying physical oceanography. I'm especially interested in problems that are easy to state yet difficult to solve as they tend to reveal a rich mathematical structure in things that are otherwise familiar.

My Ph.D. thesis broadly pertains to the dynamics of steep surface gravity waves and tries to answer the following questions:
1. Why do surface gravity waves transport mass?
2. How is this mass transport modified when waves superimpose and become locally steep?
3. Why is the shape of a breaking wave so universal?

I am passionate about improving pedagogy in the physical sciences, particularly in the field of fluid mechanics. Better teaching not only inspires future researchers, but also strengthens communication between scientific research and the broader public. 

Prior to Scripps, I received a B.A. in Physics *magna cum laude* from Cornell University with a concentration in Earth Sciences. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading, and playing jazz piano.
