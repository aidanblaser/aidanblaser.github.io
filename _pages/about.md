Welcome! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography studying the physics and dynamics behind everyday surface waves we see in the ocean. Particularly, I'm interested in the wave-induced mass transport, known as Stokes Drift, and how it is modulated by wave steepness, or the presence of multiple interacting waves.
