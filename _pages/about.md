Welcome! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography studying the physics and dynamics behind everyday surface waves we see in the ocean. Particularly, I'm interested in how water particles or other marine debris move in surface gravity waves. These waves aren't only an interesting mathematical curiosity; as the bondary between the ocean and atmosphere, they regulate transfers of heat, energy, and momentum, and have the potential to impact our climate.

Physical Oceanographic theory has historically been motivated by trying to explain observations, but I think it's just as critical to use theory to predict new phenomena, especially in areas where obtaining accurate measurements is difficult (i.e. the air-sea interface). Because of this I try to include techniques from physics and math to assist in my work.

I am passionate about teaching, and am a devout believer in Einstein's quote that "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." My ultimate goals are to become a professor in either Physical Oceanography, Fluid Mechanics, or Physics.
