Castawave is a boundary element solver for free surface potential flows, specifically adadpted to handling nonlinear surface waves. The mixed Euler-Lagrangian method used is inspired by [Dold (1992)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002199919290327U). 

This code base is using the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/), and is authored by [Aidan Blaser](https://github.com/aidanblaser) & [Raphael Benamran](https://github.com/rbenamran).
